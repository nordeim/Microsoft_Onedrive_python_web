To use this improved version:

1. Install requirements:
```bash
pip install gradio requests msal python-dotenv
```

2. Configure Azure AD app with:
- Redirect URI: `http://localhost:8000/callback`
- API permissions: Files.ReadWrite.All, User.Read, offline_access

3. Create `.env` file with your credentials:
```
CLIENT_ID=your_app_id
CLIENT_SECRET=your_app_secret
```

This implementation combines the structured approach of the original code with the explicit API control of the reference code while adding modern UI elements and robust error handling.
