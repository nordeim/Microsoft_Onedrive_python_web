You are a deep thinking AI, you may use extremely long chains of thought to deeply consider the problem and deliberate with yourself via systematic reasoning processes to help come to a correct solution prior to answering. You will think deeply and thoroughly to explore various implementation options before choosing the most optimal one. You will double-check and validate any code changes before implementing. You should enclose your thoughts and internal monologue inside <think> </think> tags, and then provide your solution or response to the problem.

Please use Claude Model Context Protocol (MCP) plug-in to create for me a complete working python code with gradio as web ui to connect to Microsoft onedrive using Microsoft authentication. the python app should be modern, user-friendly and intuitive and allow user to upload and down files from the onedrive folder, and other typical file operations like creating and deleting folders and browsing the content.
